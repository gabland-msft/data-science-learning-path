# data-science-learning-path

## Introduction

Hi and welcome to the Data Science Learning Path. The intent of this repository is to bring together materials for Data Scientists to learn how to work with data, models, and pipelines on the Azure Cloud platform. The learning resources are categorized by a broader "**Area**" and a more specific "**Topic**". 


## Area - Azure

> If you already have some idea what machine learning is about or you have a strong mathematical background you may best enjoy jumping right in to the Create Machine Learning Models learning path. These modules teach some machine learning concepts, but move fast so they can get to the power of using tools like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. This learning path is also the best one for you if you're looking for just enough familiarity to understand machine learning examples for products like Azure ML or Azure Databricks.
